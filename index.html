            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

                epistemology and computer science, see Formal learning theory.
                Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit purpose is teaching students.
                Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with classrooms of multiple students
                learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most school systems are designed
                around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices
                include curriculum.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.In India, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary
                schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12
                years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the National
                Council of Educational Research and Training.</p>

                The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical
                base to compare education systems.created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three
                levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood
                educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.</p>
